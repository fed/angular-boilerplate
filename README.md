# Angular 1.x + ES6 Boilerplate

![Angular Boilerplate](http://i.imgur.com/OJX4qxi.png)

This seed project supports:

* Angular 1.5
* Browserify
* ES6 powered by Babel
* Grunt
* Sass

## Prerequisites

* Node.js (http://nodejs.org/)

## Development Tasks

Run `npm install` the first time you clone this project in order to fetch all the dependencies.

For development purposes, Grunt's default task will automatically watch all of your source files for changes, build the appropriate distribution files and refresh the page for you. To start the app and the watch task, run `npm start`. The application will go live on [http://localhost:6789/](http://localhost:6789/).

To build the app only, run `npm run build` instead. You'll find the distribution files on the `dist` folder.

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ------ |
| `npm install` | Fetch all the dependencies. |
| `npm start` | Start development server and watch for changes. App will go live on http://localhost:6789/ |
| `npm run build` | Build all the things! Check out the `dist` folder. |
